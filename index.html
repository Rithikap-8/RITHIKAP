        	<h2>Medical value of fruits</h2> 
            <p><em>Fruits and vegetables are an indispensable part of
any diet, not only for vegetarians, but also for nonvegetarians. They are plant derivatives and generally are
matured ovaries, fruits, flowers, stems and leaves of
plants. Fruits and vegetables are important sources of
vitamins and minerals for the body. Now a days special
emphasis is being paid to the consumption of fresh fruits
and vegetable and juices and salad, as they are the
important sources of essential minerals and vitamins.
Epidemiological studies have shown the importance of a
diet rich in fruits and vegetables in the prevention of
illness, such as heart disease, cancer, metabolic disorder,
nutritional anaemia etc. Low plasma level of micronutrients
with antioxidant properties, often found in fruits and
vegetables are associated with increase risk for these
diseases.</p>
